# Brain Tumor Detection using MATLAB

This project is a MATLAB-based GUI application that allows users to detect brain tumors in MRI images using basic image processing techniques. It is built using App Designer and provides an intuitive interface to upload an image, apply median filtering, detect edges, and highlight potential tumor regions.

## Features

- Upload MRI brain scan images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`)
- Apply Median Filtering to reduce noise
- Use Sobel Edge Detection to identify edges
- Detect and Highlight Tumor regions in yellow
- View all image transformations within the GUI

## Technologies Used

- MATLAB App Designer
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Techniques: grayscale conversion, median filtering, edge detection, hole filling, segmentation
